							<ul>
								<li>
								Open up autoexec.cfg with an editor and make sure you have your name set to 
								something unique.
								<li>
								Start cube
								<li>
								go to the multiplayer menu and select "update from master server", this will 
								get you the lastest server list (you only need to do this once every day of 
								multiplayer gaming or so).
								<li>
								select the server browser in the multiplayer menu. see how all servers get 
								pinged automatically and information on player/map/game mode are displayed.
								<li>
								select a server with a good ping (near the top of the list, below 200 is very 
								playable, above may give noticable delays on gameplay events but is still 
								playable). If you don't find servers with players on, either spend some time 
								waiting for others, or come to gamesnet #cube to find people to play with.
								<li>
								run, shoot and enjoy!
								<li>
									you may want to get familiar with the various game modes cube has, and how to 
									vote for other maps and modes (again, easily done using the multiplayer menu). 
									Be cooperative with the other players on the server, and vote. Remember, press 
									T to talk to others.
								</li>
							</ul>
							Setting up a LAN game:
							<ul>
								<li>
								One of the computers on the LAN has to run server.bat. It really doesn't matter 
								which.
								<li>
								The simplest way for all players to connect is for them to type "connect 
								servername" in the cube console (press ` to get in the console), where 
								servername is the network name or ip address of the machine running server.bat. 
								if all went well you should now be in the game together, as above.
								<li>
									If your LAN is connected to the internet, by default your server will register 
									with the masterserver, and players could thus follow the procedure above to 
									join the game: your server will show up in the list, and may thus be joined by 
									people over the internet! If you want to avoid your server to contact the 
									master server, you can start it with -mlocalhost.

								for SP. Items don't respawn.

									an arena style SP mode (akin to my "DMSP" mod for quake) which you play on DM

							The models are just temp until I find some real monster models.
							<p>
							The damage given is for a single shot, where damage is simply a quarter of the 
							equivalent player gun. For the shotgun this is if he hits you at point blank 
							range, but is a lot less at distance. RL guy of course deals out splash damage 
							too.
							<p>
							Stamina is the amount of damage taken before dying, speed is their movement 
							speed in cubes/sec (player = 24), and freq is their relative frequency of 
							spawning in DMSP mode.
							<p>
							<p>
							"lag" is how long it takes them to press fire after they have decided they will 
							shoot in a particular direction, which means you can out-strafe their bullets 
							(but still get hit when standing still or moving towards them). The number is 
							in msec on skill 0, and half as big on skill 10.
							<P>
							"rate" indicates how often they will attempt to shoot you while they have you 
							in their sights. It is not an absolute fire rate measure, as fire rate is lower 
							with distance and has some absolute minimum. Again, it is also dependant on 
							skill (skill 10 fires twice as often as skill 0). "loyalty" indicates how often 
							they have to be hit by another monster in a row before they fight back.
							<P>
							Other important parameters: monsters will at most jump down 4 cubes in height, 
							unless their health is 100 or less, in which case they allways jump down.
							<P>
							As you can summise from the above, the keys to surviving in cube SP are: keep 
							moving, preferably perpendicular to the monster line of sight, 
							frequently&nbsp;move behind&nbsp;walls and back&nbsp;(this makes monsters 
							search for you again, which delays them), and use monster infighting to your 
							advantage.

					<td><font size="-1">You will notice that Cube plays better on a high ping connection 
							than most games out there. The reason for this is that just about everything in 
							cube is done clientside, not just movement (as is common in games today) but 
							also aim (the fat client / thin server model).
							<p>
							The benefits of this are that the effects of lag are minimised, and someone on 
							a 200 ping can compete on an almost even playing field with someone with a 20 
							ping, the disadvantages are mainly in that its harder to combat cheating. 
							Further advantages for server admins are that cube servers use virtually no 
							cpu, and very little bandwidth for a lot of clients (you can host a 4 player 
							game on a modem!).
							<p>It is impossible to completely hide lag however, and these are some of the 
								effects that can still show lag if you or someone you play with has a high ping 
								/ bad connection:
								<ul>
									<li>
										if the connection has packetloss. There is no direct indicator of packetloss, 
										instead the "packet jump" figure is provided on the hud (use "showscores"). 
										Packet jump says as much as the amount of milliseconds that pass between 
										updates from the indicated player. If it is extremely variable, or is 
										high(&gt;80) then your gameplay may be hampered (players jumping from place to 
										place). Ideally it is a steady 40 or lower. A consistent packet jump is more 
										vital to gameplay than ping.
										<p>
										Cube uses player prediction based on extrapolation using the physics model, in 
										an attempt to be both as up to date as possible w.r.t. to the game state, and 
										as realistic w.r.t. to physics. However, under packet loss this model breaks 
										down and player movement becomes choppy.
										<p></p>
									<li>
										if ping is high (either yours or someone you play with), some actions may 
										appear lagged. The effect of ping is generally that the players in a game are 
										effectively playing more and more seperate games, as someone with a high ping 
										is "playing in the past". The local effects of this are masked out by client 
										side movement &amp; aim, but may become noticable across players:
										<p>
											<ul>
												<li>
													you may get hit by someone even though you are already out of his view. This is 
													because he is aiming at your movements of a while ago, and his hits take a 
													while to arrive back at you. You may therefore be hit by gunfire up to his lag 
													+ your lag milliseconds after you leave his FOV.
													<p></p>
												<li>
													item pickup: you may be denied an item if you try to pick it up at virtually 
													the same time as someone else (server decides who was "first"). Item pickup is 
													server side, only when you hear the sound effect have you actually picked up 
													the item.
													<p></p>
												<li>
													players dying appears lagged. This will improve.</li>
											</ul>
										<p></p>
									<li>
										if a player is severely lagged (or you are) he temporarily becomes a "ghost" 
										that cannot be hit (if &gt;1sec packet jump).</li></ul>
